- 👋 Hi, I’m @Femiola914
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and it's implementation in cancer management and genomics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use deep learning to create models that can triage specific cancers, classifying them into benign and malignant types.
- 💞️I’m looking to collaborate on a project that involves the use of genomics to identify specific genes that can be utilized for prognosticating specific types of cancers.
